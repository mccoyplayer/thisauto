v2.5.2 - Changelog

New
---
- Added new option to test device compatibility called 'Enable Test for Home Screen' under the Misc section of the Settings page. This should make it easier to test confidence/scale settings. In addition, it will also automatically find the best scale for your device. Bot will throw an Exception to stop itself if it failed this test.
- Added and adjusted many logging messages to help me debug device compatibility when 'Debug Mode' is turned on under the Misc section of the Settings page.

Changed
---
- Changed number of tries to find button/header images from 5 to 3.
- Updated scales for tablet based on results from new compatibility test.

Fixed
---
- Fixed crash where user can input 0 as the scale.
- Fixed bug where bot can run without any summons selected in the Settings page.
