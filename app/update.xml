v3.0.0 - Changelog

New
---
- Added a new setting to enable no timeout when farming Raids that appear infrequently.
- Added a new setting to add an additional delay before taps.

Changed
---
- `IMPORTANT` Significantly sped up the entire bot process by having the creation of the source screenshot in the /temp/ folder be tied to having Debug Mode being enabled. Previously, the bot always saved the source screenshot file and thus added about 500ms every single time it was called. As a result of this change, the bot is now going lightning fast. I did not have much time to fully test out how this change affects everything else, so please report any issues by opening up a GitHub issue and/or hop into the Discord server (link is in the README).
- Brought over various minor changes from UAA for ImageUtils.
- Increased number of attempts for findAndClickButton() from 2 to 5.
- Decreased delay to regenerate source images for ImageReader.

Fixes
---
- Fixed matching functions putting the bounding box at the wrong point.
- Stopgap fix for Gintama event support.
- Attempted to fix Summon Selection page loading in at the bottom.
