v2.5.1 - Changelog

New
---
- Added new option to manually set image scale for CV operations. You can find out your scale by taking a screenshot directly on your device 
and then pick a easily recognizable image asset from the /images/folder in this repository and scaling it until it relatively matches the size 
of the asset in your screenshot. Whatever percentage you scaled the image asset by will be the number that will go into this new setting.
- Added preliminary support for devices with 720p in width (Oppo A5 2020).

Changed
---
- Readjusted image scales for tablets of 1600p in width (Galaxy Tab S7) both in portrait and landscape.
