# granblueAutomation

This Android application is designed for research purposes on automating certain workflows via text detection using Google's ML Kit.

Screenshots are taken and cropped for ML Kit to perform image processing. This will determine where the bot is currently at and will inform the bot on what to do next from there.

# Requirements (WIP)

1. An Android phone or an Android emulator via Android Studio (minSDK 29 or Android 10).
2. Granblue Fantasy account.
3. Twitter Developer account.

# Planned Features (WIP)

1. Designed to run on Android phones and Android Studio's emulators.
2. Customize what skills to use during each turn in a user-created plan. Users can select which plan to use when starting the bot.
3. Grab room codes from specified raids using user-created Twitter Developer account to connect to their API to scrape user tweets.
4. Alert for when anti-bot CAPTCHA pops up.

# Instructions (WIP)
