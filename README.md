# granblueAutomation

This is an attempt to use optical recognition technologies like OCR and OpenCV together with Android Accessibility Service to automate Granblue Fantasy. The Full Auto feature in the game already does this but does not provide any way to customize what skills to use during specific turns.

# Planned Features (WIP)

1. Customize what skills to use during each turn in a user-created plan. Users can select which plan to use when starting the bot.
2. Grab room codes from specified raids using Twitter API.
3. Alert for when anti-bot CAPTCHA pops up.

# Technologies to be Used (WIP)

1. [OpenCV - For image recognition](https://opencv.org/)
2. [Android Accessibility Service - For automated tapping on the screen](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityService)
